# Fraud-Detection-using-self-organising-maps
Implementation of Self Organizing Map that is a branch of Unsupervised Deep Learning is done over a dataset that contains information of Credit Card Applications.
This map is used further to find the group of customers who commited fraud,i.e.,those whose applications were not valid but were able to get their credit card issued.
This detection of fraud was done by calculating the Mean Inter-neuron Distance to find the outlying neurons.
The implementation of SOM is done using a project named Minisom.It can be downloaded from https://pypi.org/project/MiniSom/.
